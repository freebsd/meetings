# 20250418 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, emaste, imp

- Approved a commit bit for Lexi Winter, kevans and des to mentor
- markj still needs to write a quarterly report for srcmgr
- kevans points out that https://www.freebsd.org/internal/new-account/ is stale, says new src commit bits are granted by core@
  - lwhsu has updated it
  - srcmgr-secretary@ is just an alias for srcmgr@ for now, no real plans to change it
    - We are using individual PGP keys to sign welcome emails, there's no pressing need for a dedicated srcmgr@ PGP key
- markj wonders if we can get rid of individual opt_* headers and just use opt_global.h
  - This would avoid occasional pain from forgetting to include the right opt_* header in each file
  - Dropping them would break 3rd party code which greps them (examples?)
  - Requires some config(8) hacking
- Next steps for git
  - Want to get the ports team on board with GitHub
  - Warner wants to find ways to hook GitHub into existing systems (bugzilla, mailing lists)
  - Looking at small things we can do to make submitting PRs easier
    - Warner is working with folks on discord, trying to get some bite-sized contributions 
- LA57 default
  - Package building was disrupted because LA57 enablement breaks Go programs, as the runtime repurposes high bits in heap pointers
  - We need to address this generally for 15.0
  - markj will mail kib about it
  - https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49913
- jhb has a C++ style PR open for discussion
  - https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/pull/1658
  - Generally we should avoid forcing style(9) sensibilities onto C++ where it doesn't make much sense
    - e.g., a newline after the return type in a function definition doesn't make much sense in C++
- Spent some time on the GitHub PR backlog
  - The backlog's grown to almost 100 open PRs
  - Warner has committed his PR landing tool (ghpr)
