  - Probably just commit it to tools/git, we can add it to freebsd-git-devtools later
- jhb wants to add a gitconfig to the src repo
  - We have some issues with commit log consistency
  - A config would help us provide templates for commit trailers
- markj mailed gitadm about adding commit hooks to catch common errors

  - markj will try submitting some 
- jhb converted ctld to C++ and has some style questions; style(9) doesn't handle some C++ syntax
