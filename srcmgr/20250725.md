# 20250725 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, bnovkov, des, jhb, kevans, jfree, imp, emaste

- freebsd-update in a pkgbase world
  - There is some commentary around removing freebsd-update in 15.0
  - markj thinks it should be kept and extended to support handling upgrades in a pkgbase world
  - it already has a familiar UI and niceties like bectl integration
  - https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-pkgbase/2025-August/000625.html
- jemalloc replacement
  - upstream jemalloc development has mostly ceased, do we need to look at alternatives
  - imp is still hoping to land jemalloc updates
  - there is no particular rush to switch to an alternative
  - snmalloc is a possibility
  - we should land infrastructure for switching between in-tree malloc implementations at build-time
    - CheriBSD has this to switch between in-tree snmalloc and jemalloc
- what else are we tracking for 15.0?
  - krb5 is coming along, with some bumps. Several folks are helping with this.
  - khorben@ is working on an OpenSSL update
  - des@ is rewriting certctl in C, hopes to land it in 15.0
    - https://reviews.freebsd.org/D42320
    - more efficient than the sh version
    - handles certificates with duplicate names
    - generates a bundle rather than the hash directory, better local_unbound
    - currently stalled for lack of review
    - needs regression tests
- des@ points out that "make delete-old" is very slow
  - he has written a shell script which implements the same functionality, already much faster
  - lots of very stale entries can be removed, further speeding things up
- next steps for project ideas wiki page
  - maybe merge with the GSOC ideas page, which is better structured
    - GSOC project ideas need to be well-curated, a separate page for rougher ideas is probably best
    - srcmgr can be the point of contact for orphaned project ideas, provided the idea is still relevant
  - need to prod core@ into publishing a technical roadmap
- We spent some time on bugzilla and GitHub PR triage
