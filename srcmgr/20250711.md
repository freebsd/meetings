# 20250711 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, bnovkov, des, jhb, kevans, jfree

- Bojan has been working on a small framework for performance regression testing
  - Asks what info should be recorded (e.g., system info, etc.)
  - Hardware?
    - markj offered to host on a spare machine
    - We should look at the netperf cluster, flix1 is perhaps unused
  - What should we actually test?
    - markj: keep it really simple for now, just use will-it-scale and buildkernel of a reference tree
- Dag-Erling points out that we have no NFS regression tests
  - https://reviews.freebsd.org/D51371 already found some problems
  - https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48473
- Bojan asks if we should do bug-busting for stale phab reviews
  - lots of reviews are lost in space and time, there are useful bug-fixes there
  - many patches are OBE or not easy to validate, have unclear purpose etc.
  - it might be useful to comb through the backlog, but it's a fairly low priority
  - as usual, it's better to focus on newly submitted patches
  - many old patches can't easily be applied
  - "is git-arc documented in the handbook?"
    - seems so: https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/committers-guide/#phabricator
- Spent time going through the IdeasPage on the wiki
  - https://wiki.freebsd.org/IdeasPage
  - Bojan pointed out that many of the ideas on this list are not practical and there's
    no guarantee that patches to implement them will be accepted
    - e.g., "Implement Solaris doors" was on the list at one point and Bojan actually implemented it
  - On review, many of the ideas here are not very practical or well thought-out, some are extremely stale
    - Many can be removed, markj is cleaning up the page
  - Longer-term, we need a more polished ideas page and a published technical roadmap from the project, sourced from core@
- Olivier wrote an email with some discussion on git notes and how we can use them to encode "Fixes", "MFC", etc.
  - We will discuss further once he's back from vacation
