# 20250530 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, emaste, imp, jhb

- Held a bugbusting session on 20250523
  - About 10 people showed up
  - We tried a different approach where we rapidly went through all the previous month's PRs and put them in buckets
  - Then went backwards through higher-priority PRs and spent more time on them
  - This worked a bit better than previous sessions
- Preparing for the srcmgr talk at the devsummit in Ottawa
  - Will discuss 32-bit kernel deprecation
  - Recruit srcmgr lurkers
  - Try to drive discussions around the future of src development practices, i.e., forges, merging of bugzilla/phab/github, etc.
- Warner asks about non-standard licenses in src--whose responsibility is it to review them?
  - We eventually agreed that it's still up to core@ to set policy on licenses
  - srcmgr helps enforce the policy
