# 20250207 srcmgr meeting

Attendees: markj, emaste, imp, jhb

- markj wrote a script to help with MFCs: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49013
  - Represents a step towards a git-mfc command
- jhb has been working on a gitconfig which can automatically append "Fixes:" tags
- We are missing git commit hooks to catch common errors
  - Missing newline after commit title is probably the first mistake to start rejecting
  - Also need to require 7-bit ASCII for titles (used as email subject lines)
  - Fixes tags that are malformed or refer to non-existent commits
  - Want to be able to override these checks (e.g., for vendor/contrib commits)
- i386 removal
  - we're going to remove the i386 kernel, userspace will stay
    i.e., can still run "make buildworld TARGET=i386"
  - Warner asks if we'll have to keep i386 headers around for this
    - There are some i386 ifdefs in userspace, need to audit
      - e.g., We should still remove installer support for installing i386
    - Need to present the proposal at the BSDCan devsummit
- Let's ask for a srcmgr slot at the devsummit
  - ask for questions in advance as well as in the moment
- Will also do another bugbusting session
  - Planned for 2025/02/28
- Copyright hygiene
  - should develop a script to find any files in src that do not have a copyright (or marked as public domain)
  - would like this to become a regular test we can run to detect regressions
  - many Makefiles in the tree are not currently annotated
