# Notes
- Description of fts discussion from the Hackathon
- Capsicum-Test integration
  - "Duelling" pull requests still open:
    - https://github.com/google/capsicum-test/pull/35
    - https://github.com/google/capsicum-test/pull/40
  - Still need GoogleTest & Kyua integration
- Mark been doing code review for Mariusz' process descriptor work,
  [pdopen is in code review](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D20300)
  - For race-free signalling
  - David reports there's been recent work in Linux on this, using an entry in
    /proc
  - Some recent LWN articles
  - David asks how often the two cases are (obtaining a pd for an existing pid
    vs spawning a new process)
  - Mariusz working on a few other bugs with process descriptors (e.g. ptrace
    issues)
    - [procdesc: fix reparenting when the debugger is attached](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D20361)
    - [procdesc: allow to collect status through wait(1) if process is traced](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D20362)
  - Previous Capsicum calls have covered these sorts of issues; David recalls
    writing a document with lots of questions and now answers (and will try to
    locate it again)
- [Syzkaller work at the Hackathon](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Syzkaller), Mark 
  used `cap_enter` as an example of adding new system calls to Syzkaller
  - Teaching Syzkaller about `cap_rights_limit` and just passing junk in the
   rights is likely to be interesting too
- Mahya integrating services (e.g. cap_random, cap_grp, ...) into her test
  supervisor application (not yet a "service manager")
  - What should we do for dynamic changes (arguments)
  - Applications may need different services at different times
  - Design changed somewhat to get closer to a service manager
  - May write a paper w/ Mariusz about the sandbox manager
- David reports a renewed round of
  [`O_BENEATH`  discussions on the LKML](https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/20/1064)
